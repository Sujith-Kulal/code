#  Android Authentication App

## Overview
This Android application demonstrates a basic authentication flow using three activities:

- **MainActivity**: Initial landing screen (currently a placeholder).
- **RegisterActivity**: User registration screen.
- **LoginActivity**: User login screen.

Users can navigate between the login and registration screens using `Intent`.

##  How It Works
1. The **MainActivity** loads on app launch (currently a placeholder).

4. `TextView` elements are used for navigation (these can be replaced with buttons for better UX).
